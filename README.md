# Mortality-Rate-Prediction

Given a patient data thatcontained some features that were collected just once (at the time of patient's ICU admission), while other features were continuously monitored during the course of the patient's stay, we have to predict the mortality rate. Whether a person is going to survive or not.

I have used Random Forest Algorithm to classify the patients into survior and non-survivor

I have uploaded the dataset, data dictionary and python notebook that covers the analysis and solution for this.
